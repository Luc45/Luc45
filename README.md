### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I believe that building software should be fun and a creative process.

I am an enterprise WordPress backend developer, interested in modern development standards, and always on the lookout to learn new ways to build software that is robust, scalable, performant, and decoupled enough to sustain new features and changes in the requirements without pain or hassle. 

Got a good software book to suggest me, or want to touch base on a WordPress-related subject? Hit me up at lucasfbustamante at gmail com
