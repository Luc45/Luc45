### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PHP/Go backend developer, focused in WordPress development with automated tests.

I believe that building software should be a fun and a creative process. I'm always on the lookout to learn new ways to build software that is robust, scalable, performant, and decoupled enough to sustain new features and changes in the requirements in an easy and enjoyable way.
