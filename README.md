### Hi there 👋

I'm a PHP/Go backend developer, focused in WordPress development with strong orientation to automated tests (unit and acceptance).

I believe that building software should be a fun and a creative process. I'm always on the lookout to learn new ways to build software that is robust, scalable, performant, and decoupled enough to sustain new features and changes in the requirements without pain or hassle.
